# Group 2 // CSV Data Migration Project

This repository contains the work created by group 2 of the Sparta Global Tech 207 & Tech 208 unit on the .csv Data Migration Project.

We've built an application that enables a user to input a csv file containing a large set of employee records, sanitise/validate the records and then save it to a database. We utilised JDBC, DAO & DTO design patterns plus OOP and SOLID principles with functional programming where sensible to do so.

## Learning Objectives

* Create a DAO and a DTO
* Used the singleton pattern
* Use a factory design pattern for Employees
* Utilised Java 8+ functional programming features

## User Stories

```md

"As a USER, I WANT to read a CSV file,
 SO THAT the data can be collected." 

"As a USER, I WANT to collect clean data,
SO THAT I can store AND see how many clean records there are" 

"As a USER, I WANT un-clean data to be collected,
SO THAT I can store AND see how many un-clean records there are" 

" AS a USER, I WANT to be able to view the data,
SO THAT I can verify the data has been imported correctly." 

"AS a USER, I WANT to be able to input commands,
SO THAT I can perform actions AND I can view the records."

```

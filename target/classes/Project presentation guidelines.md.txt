# Project Presentation Guidelines

## General Points
The audience for project presentations in Sparta Global may or may not be developers,
 some will be business analysts, some will be developers but not necessarily in Java, 
some will be using programming only as a tool within a wider IT context, such as DevOps
 or security consultants. As such, you should aim your presentation at a technical, but 
not necessary developer or Java, audience. Concentrate more on the project itself, rather 
than the product.

## Presentation Contents
Your presentation should cover:
- The requirements for the project
- The planning you did (you can include a brief description of the tools if you like here)
- What you created
- The benefits it will bring (possibly including a demo)
- What did you learn?
- What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Organisation
- It is often useful to have one person organising the presentation and handing over to the individual speakers.
- Allow time for questions within your allocated time slot.
- If not everyone can be involved in the presentation itself, they can handle questions instead.
